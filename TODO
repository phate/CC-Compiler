        EDot subtyping



LLVMGenerator:
	Function application subtyping (bitcast)
    	Make it possible to not have return statement in void function (Without return; it fails atm)

Desugarer:
	Instance variables vs local in methods (Need to know what to use and when)
	Declaration statements in both methods and functions
	Increase/Decrease (id++, id--) in methods
        self.XX(), need to know where XX() is since it can be in a base class
   

ANYTHING ELSE???
