Variable array indices (For getting correct index and setting max locals)
Correct error messages when typechecking
filename parsing for correct file.j, file.class and file in JVMPrinter.hs
Change name from javac to jlc
(Fix falling of code in another way?? Instead of just adding returns??)


Files that need change for above:
JVMEnv.hs
Javac.hs (rename to jlc)
